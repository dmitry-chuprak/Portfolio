# My projects and results:

## [A/B test project](https://github.com/dmitry-chuprak/Portfolio/blob/main/AB_test_project.ipynb)

Overview: 
* new recommendation system is launched. The purpose is to check if there is a positive effect using A-B testing

Result: 
* Huge Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis was made
* AB test (using ztest) showed that new recommendation system did not fly well

## [Analysis of eBash application](https://github.com/dmitry-chuprak/Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis_of_App_eBash.ipynb)

Overview:
* We have an app like eBay with buy/sell ads
* Purpose is to divide users into groups, analyze their sessions and give recommendations where to develop the app

Result:
* Groups were divided by 1st session duration, after that cohort analysis was made
* Shortest and longest sessions showed the best retention. Average sessions (2-30 min) show the weakest retention and conversion
* Should make additional deepdive in these users
* Checked 2 hypotheses about impact of attraction Source (Yandex vs Google) and impact of ad photo show. In both cases there was no statistical difference

## [Gaming market overview](https://github.com/dmitry-chuprak/Portfolio/blob/main/Gaming_market_analysis.ipynb)

Overview:
* We work in e-shop which sells games across the world
* Objective is to analyze gaming market data (1980 - 2016) and give recommendations for 2017 forecast

Result:
* Gaming market is declining so 2017 should be not higher that 2015-16
* Forecast should include different market specics
    * North America and Europe: Xbox and PS platforms, Shooters and Sports genres are favorable
    * Japan: Nintendo and PS platforms, Role playing and Action genres are favorable
* Check 2 hypotheses: `Xbox` and `PS` platforms have similar scores (no stat diff), `Action` and `Sport` genres have different scores
